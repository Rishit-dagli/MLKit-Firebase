ML Kit is a mobile SDK that brings Google's machine learning expertise to Android and iOS apps in a powerful yet easy-to-use package. Whether you're new or experienced in machine learning, you can implement the functionality you need in just a few lines of code. There's no need to have deep knowledge of neural networks or model optimization to get started. On the other hand, if you are an experienced ML developer, ML Kit provides convenient APIs that help you use your custom TensorFlow Lite models in your mobile apps.

## Key capabilities-

1. Production-ready for common use cases 	

ML Kit comes with a set of ready-to-use APIs for common mobile use cases: recognizing text, detecting faces, identifying landmarks, scanning barcodes, labeling images, and identifying the language of text. Simply pass in data to the ML Kit library and it gives you the information you need.

2. On-device or in the cloud 	

ML Kit’s selection of APIs run on-device or in the cloud. Our on-device APIs can process your data quickly and work even when there’s no network connection. Our cloud-based APIs, on the other hand, leverage the power of Google Cloud Platform's machine learning technology to give you an even higher level of accuracy.

3. Deploy custom models 	

If ML Kit's APIs don't cover your use cases, you can always bring your own existing TensorFlow Lite models. Just upload your model to Firebase, and we'll take care of hosting and serving it to your app. ML Kit acts as an API layer to your custom model, making it simpler to run and use.
